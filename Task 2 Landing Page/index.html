    <h1>About Rishikesh</h1>
    <p> Rishikesh, also known as the “place of sagas” is a spiritual town situated 24 kms upstream from Haridwar, 
      at the confluence of the Chandrabhaga and Ganga. It is believed that God by the name of “Hrishikesh” had
       appeared as an answer to the hard penances by Rabhiya Rishi and henceforth the place derived its name. 
       It is the starting point for the Char Dham pilgrimage and an ideal destination not only for pilgrims but
      also for the people who are interested in medtation, yoga and other aspects of Hinduism. For the adventure seekers,
        Rishikesh is the suggested place for starting their trekking expeditions to the Himalayan peaks and for rafting.
       Also, International Yoga week which attracts participation from across the world, is held here, every year, in February on the banks of the Ganga.</p>

        Historically, the river banks and hills in the vicinity of the town were used by saints for yoga and meditation. Rishikesh has many internationally acclaimed ashrams. You just have to take a look around! Book yourself in for a yoga session or join for a week or month. They have a lot of options. Just walking down the streets for a few minutes, you will come across many foreigners carrying yoga mats in their pretty holders. It was for the Transcendental Meditation training course at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi that The Beatles, rock band, visited India. Their visit received a lot of media attention and the ashram where they stayed is now called the Beatles Ashram.
        
        The Ashram was abandoned in the 1990s, in 2015 government opened it for the public as a tourist attraction. They have retained the old buildings of ashram. There are meditation caves, lecture hall, the Beatles Rooms. Once you set your foot in the Ashram, you get a different vibe. The are several art works, murals, graffiti. Once in a while, you might also bump into some foreigner yogi who has been staying in Rishikesh for several years now. I met a guy who left his country 13 years ago and came to Rishikesh to practice yoga and meditation. Many devout yogis and divine gurus have been making Rishikesh their home for many years now.
        
        Rishikesh is also a great place to shop for yoga items. Look for the classic copper water bottles and yoga mat holders. Try to walk around the market to get an idea of the prices.
        
        Rishikesh, The Divine Gateway to Char Dham
        
        Rishikesh is land of spiritual sagas where mythical tales live on till today. It is the first stop for the Chardham Yatra owing largely to the fact that the holy river Ganga flows through here. Apart from that, there are some spiritual divine places in Rishikesh which makes it a must visit place for Hindus.
        
        It is said that Lakshman, brother of Lord Ram crossed Ganga on a jute rope at this place. Later a jute rope bridge was built here to honour Lakshman. That jute rope bridge was washed away in floods in 1920s. But in 1930s, the 450 feet long iron bridge connecting Pauri district with Tehri district was built. Later a similar iron suspension bridge was built about 2kms downstream to take the edge of Lakshman Jhula. Both the Jhulas offers a panoramic view of river Ganga and Rishikesh city. But I was not able to get a single good click on those iconic jhulas because of the crowd.
        
        According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva consumed poison at this place during Samudramanthan and that's how his throat turned blue. The story of Samudramanthan is depicted very well by sculptures on this temple. There is some aura surrounding this temple that is very subtle and ethereal. Around the temple is a dense forest so it is one of the great trek options. The trek starts from Ram Jhula and is about 22kms.
        
        Triveni Ghat remains overcrowded with tourists to take ritual baths to cleanse their sins. And Ganga Aarti is the main attraction at this spot. Make it a point to witness the Ganga Aarti when is Rishikesh everyday. We tried to attend the aarti from different spots during our time there. The Ganga Aarti spreads so much positivity that we were just sitting there for hours enjoying the cool breeze from the river. Do no forget to float a diya in the river and watch so many diyas floating in Ganga. It is a beautiful sight to see.
